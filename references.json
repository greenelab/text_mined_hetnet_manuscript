The quality of these\nrepresentations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are\ncompared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types\nof neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower\ncomputational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word\nvectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these\nvectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring\nsyntactic and semantic word similarities.",

    "abstract": "The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for\nlearning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large\nnumber of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we\npresent several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the\ntraining speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant\nspeedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a\nsimple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An\ninherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order\nand their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings\nof \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\".\nMotivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in\ntext, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of\nphrases is possible.",

    "abstract": "Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised\nlearning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some\napplications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and\nexpensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm\nfor the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which\nusers express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling\nfunctions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are\nnoisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training\nset labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated\ntraining set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of\nthese generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a\ndiscriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method\nover a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs.\nExperimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data\nprogramming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying\ndata programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points\nover a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the\ncompetition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that data\nprogramming may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning\nmodels when training data is limited or unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are\nuseful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn\nsuch representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct\nvector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large\nvocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach\nbased on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of\ncharacter $n$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character\n$n$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our\nmethod is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us\nto compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training\ndata. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on\nword similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed\nmorphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on these tasks.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compoundâdisease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.</jats:p>",
