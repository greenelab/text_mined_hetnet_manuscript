    "abstract": "  We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm. ",

    "abstract": "  Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some applications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which users express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training set labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated training set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data programming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the competition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that data programming may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning models when training data is limited or unavailable. ",

    "abstract": "  The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. ",

    "abstract": "  Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts. We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning BioBERT available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.

Pre-training on domain-specific corpora, such as biomedical articles, further improves their performance. In this paper, we conduct probing experiments to determine what additional information is carried intrinsically by the in-domain trained contextualized embeddings. For this we use the pre-trained LMs as fixed feature extractors and restrict the downstream task models to not have additional sequence modeling layers. We compare BERT, ELMo, BioBERT and BioELMo, a biomedical version of ELMo trained on 10M PubMed abstracts. Surprisingly, while fine-tuned BioBERT is better than BioELMo in biomedical NER and NLI tasks, as a fixed feature extractor BioELMo outperforms BioBERT in our probing tasks. We use visualization and nearest neighbor analysis to show that better encoding of entity-type and relational information leads to this superiority. ",

Most existing approaches based on natural language processing extract relations from single sentence-level co-mentions, ignoring co-occurrence statistics over the whole corpus. Existing approaches counting entity co-occurrences ignore the textual context of each co-occurrence.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results\r\n              We propose a novel corpus-wide co-occurrence scoring approach to relation extraction that takes the textual context of each co-mention into account. Our method, called CoCoScore, scores the certainty of stating an association for each sentence that co-mentions two entities. CoCoScore is trained using distant supervision based on a gold-standard set of associations between entities of interest. Instead of requiring a manually annotated training corpus, co-mentions are labeled as positives/negatives according to their presence/absence in the gold standard. We show that CoCoScore outperforms previous approaches in identifying human disease–gene and tissue–gene associations as well as in identifying physical and functional protein–protein associations in different species. CoCoScore is a versatile text mining tool to uncover pairwise associations via co-occurrence mining, within and beyond biomedical applications.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Availability and implementation\r\n              CoCoScore is available at: https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Supplementary information\r\n              Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

PubTator Central (PTC) provides automated annotations from state-of-the-art text mining systems for genes/proteins, genetic variants, diseases, chemicals, species and cell lines, all available for immediate download. PTC annotates PubMed (29 million abstracts) and the PMC Text Mining subset (3 million full text articles). The new PTC web interface allows users to build full text document collections and visualize concept annotations in each document. Annotations are downloadable in multiple formats (XML, JSON and tab delimited) via the online interface, a RESTful web service and bulk FTP. Improved concept identification systems and a new disambiguation module based on deep learning increase annotation accuracy, and the new server-side architecture is significantly faster. PTC is synchronized with PubMed and PubMed Central, with new articles added daily. The original PubTator service has served annotated abstracts for ∼300 million requests, enabling third-party research in use cases such as biocuration support, gene prioritization, genetic disease analysis, and literature-based knowledge discovery. We demonstrate the full text results in PTC significantly increase biomedical concept coverage and anticipate this expansion will both enhance existing downstream applications and enable new use cases.",

Several computational methods for drug repurposing exist, and many of these methods rely on combinations of different sources of information, extract hand-crafted features and use a computational model to predict targets or indications for a drug. One of the distinguishing features between different drug repurposing systems is the selection of features. Recently, a set of novel machine learning methods have become available that can efficiently learn features from datasets, and these methods can be applied, among others, to text and structured data in knowledge graphs.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Results\r\n            We developed a novel method that combines information in literature and structured databases, and applies feature learning to generate vector space embeddings. We apply our method to the identification of drug targets and indications for known drugs based on heterogeneous information about drugs, target proteins, and diseases. We demonstrate that our method is able to combine complementary information from both structured databases and from literature, and we show that our method can compete with well-established methods for drug repurposing. Our approach is generic and can be applied to other areas in which multi-modal information is used to build predictive models.\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Availability\r\n            \r\n              https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/multi-drug-embedding\r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Contact\r\n            \r\n              robert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",

    "abstract": "Information extraction by mining the scientific literature is key to uncovering relations between biomedical entities. Most existing approaches based on natural language processing extract relations from single sentence-level co-mentions, ignoring co-occurrence statistics over the whole corpus. Existing approaches counting entity co-occurrences ignore the textual context of each co-occurrence. We propose a novel corpus-wide co-occurrence scoring approach to relation extraction that takes the textual context of each co-mention into account. Our method, called CoCoScore, scores the certainty of stating an association for each sentence that co-mentions two entities. CoCoScore is trained using distant supervision based on a gold-standard set of associations between entities of interest. Instead of requiring a manually annotated training corpus, co-mentions are labeled as positives/negatives according to their presence/absence in the gold standard. We show that CoCoScore outperforms previous approaches in identifying human disease-gene and tissue-gene associations as well as in identifying physical and functional protein-protein associations in different species. CoCoScore is a versatile text-mining tool to uncover pairwise associations via co-occurrence mining, within and beyond biomedical applications.

    "abstract": "The automatic recognition of gene names and their associated database identifiers from biomedical text has been widely studied in recent years, as these tasks play an important role in many downstream text-mining applications. Despite significant previous research, only a small number of tools are publicly available and these tools are typically restricted to detecting only mention level gene names or only document level gene identifiers. In this work, we report GNormPlus: an end-to-end and open source system that handles both gene mention and identifier detection. We created a new corpus of 694 PubMed articles to support our development of GNormPlus, containing manual annotations for not only gene names and their identifiers, but also closely related concepts useful for gene name disambiguation, such as gene families and protein domains. GNormPlus integrates several advanced text-mining techniques, including SimConcept for resolving composite gene names. As a result, GNormPlus compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on two widely used public benchmarking datasets, achieving 86.7% F1-score on the BioCreative II Gene Normalization task dataset and 50.1% F1-score on the BioCreative III Gene Normalization task dataset. The GNormPlus source code and its annotated corpus are freely available, and the results of applying GNormPlus to the entire PubMed are freely accessible through our web-based tool PubTator.",

    "abstract": "The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.\r\n          , \r\n            Of all the data in the world today, 90% was created in the last two years. However, taking advantage of this data in order to advance our knowledge is restricted by how quickly we can access it and analyze it in a proper context.\r\n            In biomedical research, data is largely fragmented and stored in databases that typically do not “talk” to each other, thus hampering progress. One particular problem in medicine today is that the process of making a new therapeutic drug from scratch is incredibly expensive and inefficient, making it a risky business. Given the low success rate in drug discovery, there is an economic incentive in trying to repurpose an existing drug that has already been shown to be safe and effective towards a new disease or condition.\r\n            Himmelstein et al. used a computational approach to analyze 50,000 data points – including drugs, diseases, genes and symptoms – from 19 different public databases. This approach made it possible to create more than two million relationships among the data points, which could be used to develop models that predict which drugs currently in use by doctors might be best suited to treat any of 136 common diseases. For example, Himmelstein et al. identified specific drugs currently used to treat depression and alcoholism that could be repurposed to treat smoking addition and epilepsy.\r\n            These findings provide a new and powerful way to study drug repurposing. While this work was exclusively performed with public data, an expanded and potentially stronger set of predictions could be obtained if data owned by pharmaceutical companies were incorporated. Additional studies will be needed to test the predictions made by the models.",

    "abstract": "Due to an enormous number of scientific publications that cannot be handled manually, there is a rising interest in text-mining techniques for automated information extraction, especially in the biomedical field. Such techniques provide effective means of information search, knowledge discovery, and hypothesis generation. Most previous studies have primarily focused on the design and performance improvement of either named entity recognition or relation extraction. In this paper, we present PKDE4J, a comprehensive text-mining system that integrates dictionary-based entity extraction and rule-based relation extraction in a highly flexible and extensible framework. Starting with the Stanford CoreNLP, we developed the system to cope with multiple types of entities and relations. The system also has fairly good performance in terms of accuracy as well as the ability to configure text-processing components. We demonstrate its competitive performance by evaluating it on many corpora and found that it surpasses existing systems with average F-measures of 85% for entity extraction and 81% for relation extraction.
