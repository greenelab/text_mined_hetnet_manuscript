For some\napplications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and\nexpensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm\nfor the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which\nusers express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling\nfunctions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are\nnoisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training\nset labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated\ntraining set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of\nthese generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a\ndiscriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method\nover a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs.\nExperimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data\nprogramming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying\ndata programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points\nover a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the\ncompetition).

A vector representation is associated to each character\n$n$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our\nmethod is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us\nto compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training\ndata. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on\nword similarity and analogy tasks.

Biomedical relation extraction aims to\nautomatically extract biomedical relations from biomedical text for various\nbiomedical research. State-of-the-art methods for biomedical relation\nextraction are primarily based on supervised machine learning and therefore\ndepend on (sufficient) labeled data. However, creating large sets of training\ndata is prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive, especially so in\nbiomedicine as domain knowledge is required. In contrast, there is a large\namount of unlabeled biomedical text available in PubMed. Hence, computational\nmethods capable of employing unlabeled data to reduce the burden of manual\nannotation are of particular interest in biomedical relation extraction. We\npresent a novel semi-supervised approach based on variational autoencoder (VAE)\nfor biomedical relation extraction. Our model consists of the following three\nparts, a classifier, an encoder and a decoder. The classifier is implemented\nusing multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the encoder and\ndecoder are implemented using both bidirectional long short-term memory\nnetworks (Bi-LSTMs) and CNNs, respectively. The semi-supervised mechanism\nallows our model to learn features from both the labeled and unlabeled data. We\nevaluate our method on multiple public PPI, DDI and CPI corpora. Experimental\nresults show that our method effectively exploits the unlabeled data to improve\nthe performance and reduce the dependence on labeled data. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first semi-supervised VAE-based method for (biomedical)\nrelation extraction.

Recent researches on training contextualized language\nrepresentation models on text corpora shed light on the possibility of\nleveraging a large number of unannotated biomedical text corpora.

Based on the BERT architecture,\nBioBERT effectively transfers the knowledge from a large amount of biomedical\ntexts to biomedical text mining models with minimal task-specific architecture\nmodifications. While BERT shows competitive performances with previous\nstate-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the\nfollowing three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named\nentity recognition (0.51% absolute improvement), biomedical relation extraction\n(3.49% absolute improvement), and biomedical question answering (9.61% absolute\nimprovement).

Most existing approaches based on natural language processing extract relations from single sentence-level co-mentions, ignoring co-occurrence statistics over the whole corpus. Existing approaches counting entity co-occurrences ignore the textual context of each co-occurrence.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We propose a novel corpus-wide co-occurrence scoring approach to relation extraction that takes the textual context of each co-mention into account. Our method, called CoCoScore, scores the certainty of stating an association for each sentence that co-mentions two entities. CoCoScore is trained using distant supervision based on a gold-standard set of associations between entities of interest. Instead of requiring a manually annotated training corpus, co-mentions are labeled as positives/negatives according to their presence/absence in the gold standard. We show that CoCoScore outperforms previous approaches in identifying human disease–gene and tissue–gene associations as well as in identifying physical and functional protein–protein associations in different species. CoCoScore is a versatile text mining tool to uncover pairwise associations via co-occurrence mining, within and beyond biomedical applications.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>CoCoScore is available at: https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Several computational methods for drug repurposing exist, and many of these methods rely on combinations of different sources of information, extract hand-crafted features and use a computational model to predict targets or indications for a drug. One of the distinguishing features between different drug repurposing systems is the selection of features. Recently, a set of novel machine learning methods have become available that can efficiently learn features from datasets, and these methods can be applied, among others, to text and structured data in knowledge graphs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>We developed a novel method that combines information in literature and structured databases, and applies feature learning to generate vector space embeddings. We apply our method to the identification of drug targets and indications for known drugs based on heterogeneous information about drugs, target proteins, and diseases. We demonstrate that our method is able to combine complementary information from both structured databases and from literature, and we show that our method can compete with well-established methods for drug repurposing. Our approach is generic and can be applied to other areas in which multi-modal information is used to build predictive models.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability</jats:title><jats:p><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/multi-drug-embedding\">https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/multi-drug-embedding</jats:ext-link></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Contact</jats:title><jats:p><jats:email>robert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa</jats:email></jats:p></jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Information extraction by mining the scientific literature is key to uncovering relations between biomedical entities. Most existing approaches based on natural language processing extract relations from single sentence-level co-mentions, ignoring co-occurrence statistics over the whole corpus. Existing approaches counting entity co-occurrences ignore the textual context of each co-occurrence. We propose a novel corpus-wide co-occurrence scoring approach to relation extraction that takes the textual context of each co-mention into account. Our method, called CoCoScore, scores the certainty of stating an association for each sentence that co-mentions two entities. CoCoScore is trained using distant supervision based on a gold-standard set of associations between entities of interest. Instead of requiring a manually annotated training corpus, co-mentions are labeled as positives/negatives according to their presence/absence in the gold standard. We show that CoCoScore outperforms previous approaches in identifying human disease-gene and tissue-gene associations as well as in identifying physical and functional protein-protein associations in different species. CoCoScore is a versatile text-mining tool to uncover pairwise associations via co-occurrence mining, within and beyond biomedical applications. CoCoScore is available at: https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore</jats:p>",

This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Due to an enormous number of scientific publications that cannot be handled manually, there is a rising interest in text-mining techniques for automated information extraction, especially in the biomedical field. Such techniques provide effective means of information search, knowledge discovery, and hypothesis generation. Most previous studies have primarily focused on the design and performance improvement of either named entity recognition or relation extraction. In this paper, we present PKDE4J, a comprehensive text-mining system that integrates dictionary-based entity extraction and rule-based relation extraction in a highly flexible and extensible framework. Starting with the Stanford CoreNLP, we developed the system to cope with multiple types of entities and relations. The system also has fairly good performance in terms of accuracy as well as the ability to configure text-processing components. We demonstrate its competitive performance by evaluating it on many corpora and found that it surpasses existing systems with average F-measures of 85% for entity extraction and 81% for relation extraction.
