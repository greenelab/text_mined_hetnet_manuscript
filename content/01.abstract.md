## Abstract {.page_break_before}

### Background

Knowledge graphs support biomedical research efforts by providing contextual information for biomedical entities, constructing networks, and supporting the interpretation of high-throughput analyses. 
These databases are populated via some form of manual curation, which is challenging to scale with an exponentially rising publication rate. 
Data programming is a paradigm that circumvents this arduous manual process by combining databases with simple rules and heuristics written as label functions, which are programs designed to annotate textual data automatically. 
Unfortunately, writing a useful label function requires substantial error analysis and is a nontrivial task that takes multiple days per function.
This bottleneck makes populating a knowledge graph with multiple nodes and edge types practically infeasible.
We sought to accelerate the label function creation process by evaluating how label functions can be re-used across multiple edge types.
We obtained entity-tagged abstracts from Pubtator Central and subsetted these entities to only contain compounds, genes, and diseases.
Using an existing knowledge graph, Hetionet v1, we searched for sentences that mentioned the following biomedical relationships: Compound treats Disease (CtD), Gene interacts Gene (GiG), Compound binds Gene (CbG) and Disease associates Gene (DaG).
We trained a baseline model that used database-only label functions and then used a sampling approach to measure how well added edge-specific or edge-mismatch label function combinations improves over our baseline.

### Results

We found that adding additional edge-specific rather than edge-mismatch label functions often improves text annotation and shows that this approach can incorporate novel edges into our source knowledge graph.
CtD and GiG showed signs of transference as performance for both of these relationships improved.

### Conclusions

We expect that the continued development of this strategy has the potential to swiftly populate biomedical knowledge graphs with new discoveries, ensuring that these resources include cutting-edge results.
