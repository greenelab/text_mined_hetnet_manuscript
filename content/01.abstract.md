## Abstract {.page_break_before}

### Background

Knowledge graphs support biomedical research efforts by providing contextual information for biomedical entities, constructing networks, and supporting the interpretation of high-throughput analyses. 
These databases are populated via some form of manual curation, which is challenging to scale with an exponentially rising publication rate. 
Data programming is a paradigm that circumvents this arduous manual process by combining databases with simple rules and heuristics written as label functions, which are programs designed to annotate textual data automatically. 
Unfortunately, writing a useful label function requires substantial error analysis and is a nontrivial task that takes multiple days per function.
This bottleneck makes populating a knowledge graph with multiple nodes and edge types practically infeasible.
We sought to accelerate the label function creation process by evaluating how label functions can be re-used across multiple edge types.
We obtained entity-tagged abstracts from Pubtator Central and subsetted these entities to only contain compounds, genes, and diseases mentions.
Using an existing knowledge graph, Hetionet v1, we extracted sentences that mentioned the following biomedical relationships: Compound treats Disease (CtD), Gene interacts Gene (GiG), Compound binds Gene (CbG) and Disease associates Gene (DaG).
We trained a baseline model that used database-only label functions and then used a sampling approach to measure how well adding edge-specific or edge-mismatch label function combinations improve over our baseline.
We trained a discriminator model to detect sentences that indicate a biomedical relationship and then estimated the number of edge types that could be recalled and added to Hetionet v1.

### Results

We found that adding additional edge-specific rather than edge-mismatch label functions often improves text annotation.
CbG and GiG show signs of transferability as performance improved when CbG-designed label functions predict GiG and vice versa.
We found the discriminative model performance greatly depends on generated annotations and we recalled close to 30% of established edges within Hetionet v1.

### Conclusions

Our results show that this approach can incorporate novel edges into our source knowledge graph.
We expect that the continued development of this strategy has the potential to swiftly populate biomedical knowledge graphs with new discoveries, ensuring that these resources include cutting-edge results.
