## Abstract {.page_break_before}

### Background

Knowledge graphs support biomedical research efforts by providing contextual information for biomedical entities, constructing networks, and supporting the interpretation of high-throughput analyses. 
These databases are populated via manual curation, which is challenging to scale with an exponentially rising publication rate. 
Data programming is a paradigm that circumvents this arduous manual process by combining databases with simple rules and heuristics written as label functions, which are programs designed to annotate textual data automatically. 
Unfortunately, writing a useful label function requires substantial error analysis and is a nontrivial task that takes multiple days per function.
This bottleneck makes populating a knowledge graph with multiple nodes and edge types practically infeasible.
Thus, we sought to accelerate the label function creation process by evaluating how label functions can be re-used across multiple edge types.

### Results

We obtained entity-tagged abstracts and subsetted these entities to only contain compounds, genes, and disease mentions.
We extracted sentences containing co-mentions of certain biomedical entities contained in a previously described knowledge graph, Hetionet v1.
We trained a baseline model that used database-only label functions and then used a sampling approach to measure how well adding edge-specific or edge-mismatch label function combinations improved over our baseline.
Next, we trained a discriminator model to detect sentences that indicated a biomedical relationship and then estimated the number of edge types that could be recalled and added to Hetionet v1.
We found that adding additional edge-specific rather than edge-mismatch label functions often improves text annotation.
An exception to this trend was two edge types, Compound-binds-Gene and Gene-interacts-Gene, as these edges showed signs of transferability.
We found the discriminative model performance strongly depends on generated annotations.
Using the best discriminative model for each edge type, we recalled close to 30% of established edges within Hetionet v1.

### Conclusions

Our results show that this framework can incorporate novel edges into our source knowledge graph.
We expect that the continued development of this strategy has the potential to swiftly populate biomedical knowledge graphs with new discoveries, ensuring that these resources include cutting-edge results.
