### Generative Model Using Randomly Sampled Label Functions

Creating label functions is a labor-intensive process that can take days to accomplish.
We sought to accelerate this process by measuring how well label functions can be reused.
We evaluated this notion by performing an experiment where label functions are sampled on an individual (edge vs. edge) level and a global (collective pool of sources) level.
We observed that performance increased when edge-specific label functions were added to an edge-specific baseline model, while label function reuse usually provided less benefit (AUROC Figure {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set}, AUPR Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set}).
The quintessential example of this overarching trend is the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type, where edge-specific label functions consistently outperformed transferred label functions.
However, there is evidence that label function transferability is possible for selected edge types and label function sources. 
Performance increases as more GiG label functions are incorporated into the CbG baseline model and vice versa.
This trend suggests that sentences for GiG and CbG may share similar linguistic features or terminology that allows for label functions to be reused.
Perplexingly, edge-specific Disease associates Gene (DaG) label functions did not improve performance over label functions drawn from other edge types.
Overall, only CbG and GiG showed significant signs of reusability.
This pattern suggests that label function transferability may be possible for these two edge types.

Edge-specific label functions perform better than edge-mismatch label functions, but certain mismatch situations show signs of successful transfer.
Each line plot header depicts the edge type the generative model is trying to predict, while the colors represent the source of label functions.
For example, orange represents sampling label functions designed to predict the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type.
The x-axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions incorporated as an addition to the database-only baseline model (the point at 0).
The y-axis shows the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC).
Each point on the plot shows the average of 50 sample runs, while the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of all runs.
The baseline and “All” data points consist of sampling from the entire fixed set of label functions.

We found that sampling from all label function sources at once usually underperformed relative to edge-specific label functions (Figure {@fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}).
The gap between edge-specific sources and all sources widened as we sampled more label functions.
CbG is a prime example of this trend (Figure {@fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}), while CtD and GiG show a similar but milder trend.
DaG was the exception to the general rule.
The pooled set of label functions improved performance over the edge-specific ones, which aligns with the previously observed results for individual edge types (Figure {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set}).
When pooling all label functions, the decreasing trend supports the notion that label functions cannot simply transfer between edge types (exception being CbG on GiG and vice versa).

Using all label functions generally hinders generative model performance.

### Discriminative Model Performance

The discriminative model is designed to augment performance over the generative model by incorporating textual features along with estimated training labels.
The discriminative model is a piecewise convolutional neural network trained over word embeddings (See Methods and Materials).
We found that the discriminative model generally out-performed the generative model as more edge-specific label functions are incorporated (Figure {@fig:auroc_discriminative_model_performance} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_discriminative_model_performance}).
The discriminative model's performance is often poorest when very few edge-specific label functions are added to the baseline model (seen in Disease associates Gene (DaG), Compound binds Gene (CbG) and Gene interacts Gene (GiG)). 
This suggests that generative models trained with more label functions produce outputs that are more suitable for training discriminative models.
An exception to this trend is Compound treats Disease (CtD) where the discriminative model out-performs the generative model at all levels of sampling.
We observed the opposite trend with the Compound-binds-Gene (CbG) edges: the discriminative model was always poorer or indistinguishable from the generative model.
Interestingly, the AUPR for CbG plateaus below the generative model and decreases when all edge-specific label functions are used (Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_discriminative_model_performance}).
This suggests that the discriminative model might be predicting more false positives in this setting.
Incorporating more edge-specific label functions usually improves performance for the discriminative model over the generative model.

The discriminative model usually improves at a faster rate than the generative model as more edge-specific label function are included.
The line plot headers represent the specific edge type the discriminative model is trying to predict.
The x-axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions that are incorporated into the baseline model (point at 0).
The y axis shows the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC).
Each datapoint represents the average of 50 sample runs and the error bars represent the 95% confidence interval of each run.
The baseline and “All” data points consist of sampling from the entire fixed set of label functions.
