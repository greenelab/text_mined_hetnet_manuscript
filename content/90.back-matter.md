### Generative Model Using Randomly Sampled Label Functions

#### Individual Sources

![
Edge-specific label functions improve performance over edge-mismatch label functions.
Each line plot header depicts the edge type the generative model is trying to predict, while the colors represent the source of label functions.
For example, orange represents sampling label functions designed to predict the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type.
The x-axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions incorporated as an addition to the database-only baseline model (the point at 0).
The y-axis shows the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR).
Each point on the plot shows the average of 50 sample runs, while the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of all runs.
The baseline and “All” data points consist of sampling from the entire fixed set of label functions.

#### Collective Pool of Sources

Using all label functions generally hinders generative model performance.

The x-axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions incorporated as an addition to the database-only baseline model (the point at 0).

### Discriminative Model Performance

![
The discriminator model improves performance as the number of edge-specific label functions is added to the baseline model.
The line plot headers represent the specific edge type the discriminator model is trying to predict.
The x-axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions incorporated as an addition to the baseline model (the point at 0).
The y axis shows the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR).
Each data point represents the average of 3 sample runs for the discriminator model and 50 sample runs for the generative model.
The error bars represent each run's 95% confidence interval.
The baseline and "All" data points consist of sampling from the entire fixed set of label functions.
