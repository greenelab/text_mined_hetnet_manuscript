#### Label Function Categories

Label functions can be constructed in a multitude of ways; however,  many label functions share similar characteristics with one another.
We grouped these characteristics into the following categories: databases, text patterns and domain heuristics.
Most of our label functions fall into the text pattern category, while the others were distributed across the database and domain heuristic categories (Supplemental Table {@tbl:label-functions}).
Further, we described each category and provided an example that refers to the following candidate sentence: "[PTK6]{.gene_color} may be a novel therapeutic target for [pancreatic cancer]{.disease_color}".

**Databases**: These label functions incorporate existing databases to generate a signal, as seen in distant supervision [@doi:10.3115/1690219.1690287].
These functions detect if a candidate sentence's co-mention pair is present in a given database.
If the pair is present, our label function emits a positive label and abstains otherwise.
If the pair is not present in any existing database, a separate label function emits a negative label.
We used a separate label function to prevent a label imbalance problem that we encountered during development: emitting positives and negatives from the same label function causes downstream classifiers to generate almost exclusively negative predictions.

$$ \Lambda_{DB}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 1 & (\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) \in DB \\
0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$

$$ \Lambda_{\neg DB}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 -1 & (\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) \notin DB \\
0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$

**Domain Heuristics**: These label functions used results from published text-based analyses to generate a signal. 
For our project, we used dependency path cluster themes generated by Percha et al. [@tag:global_network].
If a candidate sentence's dependency path belonged to a previously generated cluster, then the label function emitted a positive label and abstained otherwise.

$$
\Lambda_{DH}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = \begin{cases}
    1 & Candidate \> Sentence \in Cluster \> Theme\\
    0 & otherwise \\
    \end{cases}
$$

**Text Patterns**: These label functions are designed to use keywords and sentence context to generate a signal. 
For example, a label function could focus on the number of words between two mentions or focus on the grammatical structure of a sentence.
These functions emit a positive or negative label depending on the context.

$$ \Lambda_{TP}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 1 & "target" \> \in Candidate \> Sentence \\
 0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$

$$ \Lambda_{TP}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 -1 & 	"VB" \> \notin pos\_tags(Candidate \> Sentence) \\
 0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$

Each text pattern label function was constructed by manual examination of sentences within the training set.
For example, in the candidate sentence above, one would extract the keywords "novel therapeutic target" and incorporate them in a text pattern label function.
After initial construction, we tested and augmented the label function using sentences in the tune set.
We repeated this process for every label function in our repertoire. 

| Relationship | Databases (DB) | Text Patterns (TP) | Domain Heuristics (DH) |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| DaG | 7 | 20 | 10 | 
| CtD | 3 | 15 | 7 |
| CbG | 9 | 13 | 7 | 
| GiG | 9 | 20 | 8 |

### Training Models

#### Generative Model

The generative model is a core part of this automatic annotation framework.
It integrates multiple signals emitted by label functions and assigns a training class to each candidate sentence.
This model assigns training classes by estimating the joint probability distribution of the latent true class ($Y$) and label function signals ($\Lambda$), ($P_{\theta}(\Lambda, Y)$).
Assuming each label function is conditionally independent, the joint distribution is defined as follows:  

$$
P_{\theta}(\Lambda, Y) = \frac{\exp(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \theta^{T}F_{i}(\Lambda, y))}
{\sum_{\Lambda'}\sum_{y'} \exp(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \theta^{T}F_{i}(\Lambda', y'))}
$$  

where $m$ is the number of candidate sentences, $F$ is the vector of summary statistics and $\theta$ is a vector of weights for each summary statistic.
The summary statistics used by the generative model are as follows:  

$$F^{Lab}_{i,j}(\Lambda, Y) = \unicode{x1D7D9}\{\Lambda_{i,j} \neq 0\}$$
$$F^{Acc}_{i,j}(\Lambda, Y) = \unicode{x1D7D9}\{\Lambda_{i,j} = y_{i,j}\}$$   

*Lab* is the label function's propensity (the frequency of a label function emitting a signal).
*Acc* is the individual label function's accuracy given the training class.
This model optimizes the weights ($\theta$) by minimizing the negative log likelihood:

$$\hat{\theta} = argmin_{\theta} -\sum_{\Lambda} \sum_{Y} log P_{\theta}(\Lambda, Y)$$

In the framework we used predictions from the generative model, $\hat{Y} = P_{\hat{\theta}}(Y \mid \Lambda)$, as training classes for our dataset [@doi:10.14778/3157794.3157797; @doi:10.1145/3209889.3209898]. 

#### Discriminative Model

The discriminative model is a neural network trained to produce classification labels by integrating predicted probabilities from the generative model along with sentence representations via word embeddings.
The goal of this combined approach is to develop models that learn text features associated with the overall task, beyond the supplied label functions.
We used a piecewise convolutional neural network that contains multiple kernel filters as our discriminative model.
We built a network with multiple filters using a fixed width of 300 (size of word embeddings) and a fixed height of 7 (Figure {@fig:convolutional_network}).
We chose a fixed height of 7 because this height was previously reported to optimize performance in relationship classification [@arxiv:1510.03820].
We trained this model for 15 epochs using the Adam optimizer [@arxiv:1412.6980] with PyTorch's default parameter settings and a learning rate of 0.001 that decreases by half every epoch until the lower bound of 1e-5 is reached, which we observed was often sufficient for convergence.
We added a L2 penalty (lambda=0.002) on the network weights to prevent overfitting.
Lastly, we added a dropout layer (p=0.25) between the fully connected layer and the softmax layer.

![
The architecture of the discriminative model was a convolutional neural network.
We performed a convolution step using multiple filters. 
The filters generated a feature map that was sent into a maximum pooling layer that was designed to extract the largest feature in each map.
The extracted features were concatenated into a singular vector that was passed into a fully connected network. 
The fully connected network had 300 neurons for the first layer, 100 neurons for the second layer and 50 neurons for the last layer. 
The last step of the fully connected network was to generate predictions using a softmax layer.

#### Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are representations that map individual words to real valued vectors of user-specified dimensions.
These embeddings have been shown to capture the semantic and syntactic information between words [@arxiv:1310.4546].
We trained Facebook's fastText [@arxiv:1607.04606] using all candidate sentences for each individual relationship pair to generate word embeddings.
FastText uses a skip-gram model [@arxiv:1301.3781] that aims to predict the surrounding context for a candidate word and pairs the model with a novel scoring function that treats each word as a bag of character n-grams.
We trained this model for 20 epochs using a window size of 2 and generated 300-dimensional word embeddings.
We use the optimized word embeddings as input to our discriminative model. 

#### Calibration of the Discriminative Model

Often many tasks require a machine learning model to output reliable probability predictions. 
A model is well calibrated if the probabilities emitted from the model match the observed probabilities.
For example, a well-calibrated model that assigns a class label with 80% probability should have that class appear 80% of the time.
Deep neural network models can often be poorly calibrated [@arxiv:1706.04599; @arxiv:1807.00263].
These models are usually over-confident in their predictions.
For this reason, we calibrated our convolutional neural network using temperature scaling [@arxiv:1706.04599]. 
Temperature scaling uses a parameter T to scale each value of the logit vector (z) before being passed into the softmax (SM) function.

$$\sigma_{SM}(\frac{z_{i}}{T}) = \frac{\exp(\frac{z_{i}}{T})}{\sum_{i}\exp(\frac{z_{i}}{T})}$$

We found the optimal T by minimizing the negative log likelihood (NLL) of the tune set.

### Discriminative Model Calibration

![
Deep learning models are overconfident in their predictions and need to be calibrated after training.
These are calibration plots for the discriminative model, where the green line represents the predictions before calibration and the blue line shows predictions after calibration. 
Data points that lie closer to the diagonal line show better model calibration, while data points far from the diagonal line show poor performance.
A perfectly calibrated model would align straight along the diagonal line. 
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danich1/snorkeling/c76e683a7bbc97482335ed4ac9ef8ab81c46114d/figures/model_calibration_experiment/model_calibration.png){#fig:discriminative_model_calibration}

Even deep learning models with impressive AUROC and AUPR statistics can be subject to poor calibration.
Typically, these models are overconfident in their predictions [@arxiv:1706.04599; @arxiv:1807.00263].
We attempted to use temperature scaling to fix the calibration of the best performing discriminative models (Figure {@fig:discriminative_model_calibration}).
Before calibration (green lines), our models were aligned with the ideal calibration only when predicting low probability scores (close to 0.25).
Applying the temperature scaling calibration algorithm (blue lines) did not substantially improve the calibration of the model in most cases.
The exception to this pattern is the Disease associates Gene (DaG) model where high confidence scores are shown to be better calibrated.
Overall, calbrating deep learning models is a nontrivial task that requires  more complex approaches to accomplish.

### Text Mined Edges Can Expand a Database-derived Knowledge Graph

![
Text-mined edges recreate a substantial fraction of an existing knowledge graph and include new predictions.
This bar chart shows the number of edges we can successfully recall in green and shows the number of new edges that can be added in blue.  
The recall for the Hetionet v1 knowledge graph is shown as a percentage in parentheses.
For example, for the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge our method recalls 85% of existing edges and adds 6,088 new edges.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danich1/snorkeling/c76e683a7bbc97482335ed4ac9ef8ab81c46114d/figures/edge_prediction_experiment/edges_added.png){#fig:hetionet_reconstruction}

One of the goals in our work is to measure the extent to which learning multiple edge types could construct a biomedical knowledge graph.
Using Hetionet v1 as an evaluation set, we measured this framework's recall and quantified how many new edges could be added with high confidence.
Overall, we were able to recall more than half of preexisting edges for all edge types (Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction}) and report our top ten scoring sentences for each edge type in Supplemental Table {@tbl:edge_prediction_tbl}.
Our best recall is with the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type, where we retain 85% of preexisting edges.
Plus, we can add over 6,000 new edges to that category.
In contrast, we could only recall close to 70% of existing edges for the other categories; however, we can add over 40,000 novel edges to each category.
This highlights the fact that Hetionet v1 is missing a compelling amount of biomedical information and this framework is a viable way to close the information gap.

### Comparison with CoCoScore using Hetionet v1 as an Evaluation Set

![
Our extractor shows similar performance to a previously published method when using Hetionet v1 as an evaluation set.
We compared our model (blue) with the CoCoScore model [@tag:cocoscore] (green).
The y axis represents AUROC and the x axis represents the edge type both models are trying to predict.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danich1/snorkeling/b6e707ea843ac5d66f62ed09277e6b1d3d4b8bf3/figures/literature_models/coco_score_auroc.png){#fig:cocoscore_comparison}

Our model showed promising performance in terms of recalling edges in Hetionet v1.
We assessed our model's performance relative to a recently published method [@tag:cocoscore].
Though our method is primarily designed to predict assertions, not edges, we compared performance at an edge level because this was available for CoCoScore.
We found that a simple summary approach, max sentence score, provided comparable performance to the CoCoScore for the compound treats disease (CtD) edge type and slightly poorer performance for other edge types (Supplemental Figure {@fig:cocoscore_comparison}).
Sentence-level scores can be integrated in multiple ways, and approaches that consider more complexity (e.g., the number of sentences with high-probability) should be evaluated in future work.
