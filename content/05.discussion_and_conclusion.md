## Discussion

Filling out knowledge bases via manual curation can be an arduous and erroneous task [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229].
Using manual curation alone becomes impractical as the rate of publications continuously increases.
Data programming is a paradigm that uses label functions to speed up the annotation process and can be used to solve this problem.
However, creating useful label functions is an obstacle to this paradigm, which takes considerable time.
We tested the feasibility of re-using label functions to reduce the number of label functions required for strong prediction performance.

Our sampling experiment revealed that adding edge-specific label functions is better than adding off-edge label functions.
An exception to this trend is using label functions designed from conceptually related edge types (using GiG label functions to predict CbG sentences and vice versa).
Furthermore, broad edge types such as DaG did not follow this trend as we found this edge to be agnostic to any tested label function source.
One possibility for this observation is that the "associates" relationship is a general concept that may include other concepts such as Disease (up/down) regulating a Gene (examples highlighted in our [annotated sentences](https://github.com/greenelab/text_mined_hetnet_manuscript/tree/master/supplementary_materials/annotated_sentences)).
These two results suggest that the structure of biomedical language contains similar text when describing straightforward relationship types and vice versa for broader relationship types.
Similarly, we hypothesize that this textual property will hold when extending this work to incorporate other relationship types such as  Disease presents Symptom or Compound causes Side Effects.

The discriminator model did not have an apparent positive or negative effect on performance; however, we noticed that performance heavily depended on the annotations provided by the generative model.
This pattern suggests a focus on label function construction and generative model training may be key steps to focus on in future work.
Although we found that label functions cannot be re-used across all edge types with the standard task framing, strategies like multitask [@doi:10.1145/3209889.3209898] or transfer learning [@doi:10.1186/s40537-016-0043-6] may make multi-label-function efforts more successful.

## Conclusions

Regarding knowledge graph construction, the amount of work required will scale linearly based on the number of various edge types.
When using this framework one should expect to have at least 25-30 different label functions per relationship type.
During the label function design process, one should be cautious about the language used to describe relationship types.
For example, a broad biomedical relationship may use a plethora of textual keywords and phrases to describe the relationship.
Overall, we expect similar frameworks to be incorporated in future endeavors.
